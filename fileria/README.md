GithubD Project for database.

In our lives, we all have certain things to write. Sometimes we want to comment on blogs, sometimes social sharing, sometimes activities, sometimes a current news. We are creating a content system for blogs, news portals, instant streaming and more. Those who accept these contents are exhibited together with githubd project in github. And active participant developers, we want these contents to be translated into all languages around the world because we are an international project. Hopefully we can reach a mass of readers with more participants and international content.
